1.The sinusoidal model assumes that a sound can be modeled as 
	a sum of time-varying sinusoids

2.The frequency of a sinusoid in the spectrum can be obtained by
	measuring the location of the spectral peak corresponding to the sinusoid

3.To distinguish two sinusoids having a frequency distance of delta-f we have to select a window
	whose spectral main lobe is narrower to delta-f

4.A spectral peak is detected by
	finding a local maxima in the magnitude spectrum

5.With parabolic interpolation we can
	improve the frequency, magnitude, and phase measure of a spectral peak

6.Time-varying sinusoids can be identified by
	tracking the location of spectral peaks in time

7.To synthesize a sinusoid in the spectral domain we can
	generate the spectrum of a window and place it at the location of the desired sinusoid

8.The duration of the time domain sinusoid obtained by performing the inverse FFT of its spectrum is equal to
	the size of the fft used

9.The reason for using the main-lobe of the spectrum of the Blackman-Harris window for the sinuosidal synthesis is because
	wiht just 8 samples we can generate a sinusoid in the spectrum

X 10.The size of the inverse FFT used in the sinusoidal synthesis discussed in class
	does not have to be the same than the FFT size used in the analysis of the sinusoids
